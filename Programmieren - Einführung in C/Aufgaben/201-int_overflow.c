/* check_int_overflow.c Check when integer numbers are overflowing */
// TO DO 1: complete the overflow detecion for other types 
// TO DO 2: extend this to unsigned integers 
// TO DO 3: stop counting after first overflow 
// TO DO 4: estimate how many operations are performed per second.
// TO DO 5 (optional): Use this program as benchmark for your CPU performance and compare it with other students' computers,
// TO DO 6 (optional): Check the CPU load when running the programm. What do you observe?
